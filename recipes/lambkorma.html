<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Lamb Korma is a traditional Indian dish known for its rich and creamy sauce made with yogurt, cream, and a blend of aromatic spices. Tender pieces of lamb are slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in a flavorful and comforting meal.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>500g lamb, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ghee or oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ginger, grated</li>
    <li>1 cup yogurt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
